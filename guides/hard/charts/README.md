# Section 4: Visualisation using MongoDB Charts
Visualise the data you loaded into your MongoDB Atlas cluster in [step 2](../data-migration) using MongoDB Charts.

Once you are done with it you can compare your solution to [Solution A](https://github.com/mcinteerj/rdbms-mdb-migration-workshop/blob/main/guides/solutions/Aggregation1Charts.png) and [Solution B](https://github.com/mcinteerj/rdbms-mdb-migration-workshop/blob/main/guides/solutions/Aggregation2Chart.png)
