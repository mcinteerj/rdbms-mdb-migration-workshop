# Aggregation Pipeline

In this exercise, you will use MongoDB’s powerful Aggregation Pipeline to run analytics queries on the collection(s) you created in the previous exercise. 

**You have received the following requests from your marketing team: **
```
 Find out the average call duration by Gender across all subscribers (Assume that the data contains only two types of genders: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’).
 Find out the ‘Peak Calling Time’ by analysing the total number of calls made per hour by all subscribers (Note: Group the data by hour, starting from 00 to 23
```
Once you have completed the aggregations you can compare it to the Solution [A](https://github.com/mcinteerj/rdbms-mdb-migration-workshop/blob/main/guides/solutions/Aggregation1.md) and [B](https://github.com/mcinteerj/rdbms-mdb-migration-workshop/blob/main/guides/solutions/Aggregation2.md)
