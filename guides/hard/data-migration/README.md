# Data Migration hard path

In this section the goal is to migrate the data from the Relationnal Database to MongoDB.
On this workshop we will be using MongoSyphon available in the Resources folder.
As it is the hard path, you are free to use any ETL you see fit, the only requirement is to load the data in your cluster following a schema that takes into account all the parameters given.
At the end of this step you should have your data in the ```Hackathon``` Database.
You can compare your result with our [Solution](https://github.com/mcinteerj/rdbms-mdb-migration-workshop/blob/main/guides/solutions/DataMigrationSolution.json). Note: The solution is the config file for MongoSyphon.
