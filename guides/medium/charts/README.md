# Section 4: Visualisation using MongoDB Charts
Visualise the data you loaded into your MongoDB Atlas cluster in [step 2](../data-migration) using MongoDB Charts.

## Instructions
MongoDB Charts is included as part of the MongoDB Cloud platform and can be accessed through the Atlas platform. The following steps will help you get started:

* Click on the ‘Charts’ tab on your Atlas Cluster Screen

* Select the type of the chart you wish to create from the ‘Chart Type’ drop-down menu

You are now ready to make the vizualisation of your aggregations.

**Hint: Charts can and is really close to the aggregation framework to produce the visualization.**
